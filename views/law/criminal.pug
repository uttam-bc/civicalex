        h2 Step 1: What is Criminal Law about?
        p Criminal law deals with conduct that is prohibited by the state because it threatens, harms, or otherwise endangers the safety and welfare of the public. In India, criminal law is primarily governed by the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973.
        p This area of law covers crimes against persons, property, public order, and the state, along with procedures for investigation, prosecution, and punishment.
