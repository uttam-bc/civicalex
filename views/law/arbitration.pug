        h2 Step 1: What is Arbitration & Conciliation about?
        p Arbitration and conciliation law governs alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that provide faster and more cost-effective alternatives to traditional court litigation. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, governs these processes in India.
        p These methods involve neutral third parties who help resolve disputes outside the formal court system. Arbitration results in binding decisions, while conciliation aims at mutually acceptable settlements between parties.
