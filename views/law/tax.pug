        h2 Step 1: What is Tax Law about?
        p Tax law governs the system of government levies on economic transactions, including income, property, sales, and services. In India, the primary tax laws include the Income Tax Act, 1961, and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime introduced in 2017.
        p Tax law encompasses the rules for tax calculation, collection, compliance, and dispute resolution. It affects individuals, businesses, and other entities, with different rates and procedures based on the taxpayer category and transaction type.
